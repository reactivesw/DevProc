# Test
We take testing seriously -- for any code, if it is not tested, it is not done. Therefore our testing goal is 100% brach coverage. If the goal is not achieved, there should be some reasonable explanation in the testing code.

## 1. Testing Tool
We use Spock Framework as our unit testing framework. https://github.com/spockframework/spock has links to many Spock resources.

## 2. Integration Testing Tool
TBD
