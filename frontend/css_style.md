# CSS Style Guideline

We use bootstrap4. For the main branch project, should keep the style simple by only use the built-in constructors. 

We use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) to add some simple symbols and icons.

Use default styles as much as possible. For example, use `btn-primary` instead of `btn-outline-primary`.
