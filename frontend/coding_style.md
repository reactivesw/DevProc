# Coding Style
If there is no strong good reason, we just follow the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard) and [AirBnb CSS and SASS Style](https://github.com/airbnb/css). (css lint is not available yet, can't find a acceptable way to lint both .scss and .vue files.) Anything not follow these styles should be explicitly documented here.
