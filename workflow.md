First, there is a requirement document describing the use cases /user stories of the features/functions of the program. Both normal cases and abnormal cases are described. 

Then comes the design document showing how to implement the features/functions. The design can be in different format: class diagrams, rpc interface, event bus message etc. 

In development phase, there are a set of related artifacts: consistent design docs, testing code, commens, code, build scripts. Review, commit, build frequently so changes are introduced in small batches.
